# Amazon SageMaker reusable components
This solution shows how to deliver reusable and self-contained custom components to [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker) environment using [AWS Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/), [SageMaker Projects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-projects-whatis.html) and [SageMaker Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/).

## Introduction
Amazon SageMaker helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for machine learning.

[Amazon SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/) is a web-based, integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning (ML) that lets you build, train, debug, deploy, and monitor your ML models.

To implement reusable, reproducible, and governed custom components in your SageMaker environment, you can use a SageMaker project. A SageMaker project is a self-sufficient end-to-end ML component, which can be instantiated and used by the entitled users of SageMaker Studio. A project is delivered and provisioned via AWS Service Catalog and contains all resources, artifacts, source code, and permissions, which are needed to perform a designated task or a whole workflow in your SageMaker environment.

You can provision a SageMaker project directly in Studio IDE or via [SageMaker API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateProject.html). The provisioning happens under a designated IAM role, which assumed by AWS Service Catalog and contains permission specifically needed to perform project template deployment. The Service Catalog-based approach allows you and your ML team to provision any custom ML components and workflows centrally without requiring each ML user to have high-profile permission policies or going via a manual and non-reproducible individual deployment process.

By implementing custom reusable components in with SageMaker projects, you can separate the development, testing, and deployment process for ML components from their employment. 

This solution shows step-by-step how to author and employ such a reusable component on example of a specific ML use case.

## Use case
As an example of an ML workflow, delivered as a [custom SageMaker project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-projects-templates-custom.html), we take a use case of an automated pipeline for data transformation and ingestion into [SageMaker Feature Store](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/feature-store/). This workflow combines various AWS services and SageMaker components, such as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [SageMaker Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/), [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), and [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) to create a self-contained ML component, which you can directly use in your own solution or architecture.

The following diagram shows the functional view of the workflow.

![](design/solution-functional-view.drawio.svg)

On a high level, the workflow comprises the following steps:
1. Data file or files uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket
2. Data processing and transformation is launched 
3. Extracted, processed, and transformed features are ingested into a designated [feature group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store-getting-started.html) in Feature Store



## Solution architecture
The detailed component architecture of the solution is presented in the following diagram.

![](design/feature-store-ingestion-pipeline.drawio.svg)

The _Automated FS data ingestion component_ **(1)** is delivered as part of a broader product portfolio **(2)**, which can contain multiple products. In this solution we have only one product in the portfolio. Both the product (1) and the product portfolio (2) are defined by [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates. A CloudFormation template **(3)** with the product contains all resources, artifacts, and permissions, which are needed to provision the product in your SageMaker environment.

By the deployment of the product via AWS CloudFormation service, a new SageMaker project **(4)** is created in SageMaker environment. You can see all project artifacts and resources in Studio IDE in **Projects** widget.

The SageMaker project implements the feature ingestion pipeline **(5)**. The pipeline contains a Lambda function, which is launched by [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) rule each time a new object is uploaded into a monitored Amazon S3 bucket. The Lambda function starts a SageMaker Pipeline **(6)** which is defined and provisioned as a part of the SageMaker project. The pipeline contains one step with Data Wrangler processor for data transformation and ingestion into a feature group in SageMaker Feature Store. The pipeline source code is also delivered as a part of the project in an [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) repository **(7)**.

The following section provides implementation details for each part of the SageMaker project. You can use these instructions and code to develop your own ML component.

## Authoring of SageMaker project template
To get started with a SageMaker project, you need the following resources, artifacts, IAM roles and permissions:
- A CloudFormation template which defines a Service Catalog [portfolio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/what-is_concepts.html)
- A CloudFormation template which defines a SageMaker project
- IAM roles and permissions needed to run your project components and perform project's tasks and workflows
- If your project contains any source code delivered as a part of the project, this code must be also delivered and referred as "seed code"

Each of the following sections describes each part of the project and gives examples of source code.

### Service Catalog portfolio
An AWS Service Catalog portfolio is delivered as a CloudFormation template, which defines the following resources:
- Portfolio definition
- Product or products definition
- Product to portfolio association for each product
- Portfolio to IAM principle association. This defines which IAM principle or principles can deploy products in the portfolio.
- Product launch role constraint. This defines which IAM role the CloudFormation service assumes when user provisions the template

To make your project template available in your **Organization templates** list in Studio, add the following tag to the product:

```yaml
    Tags:
    - Key: 'sagemaker:studio-visibility'
        Value: 'true'
```

Refer to [Amazon SageMaker documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-projects-templates-custom.html) for more details.

This solution contains a [working example](cfn-templates/sm-project-sc-portfolio.yaml) of a Service Catalog portfolio containing one product.

### Project CloudFormation template
A product is a CloudFormation template. Product's template contains all resources, permissions, and artifacts, which are needed to deliver the product's functionality.

For the product to work with SageMaker projects, you must add the following parameters to your product template:

```yaml
  SageMakerProjectName:
    Type: String
    Description: Name of the project
    MinLength: 1
    MaxLength: 32
    AllowedPattern: ^[a-zA-Z](-*[a-zA-Z0-9])*

  SageMakerProjectId:
    Type: String
    Description: Service generated Id of the project.
```

This solution contains [a product template](cfn-templates/project-s3-fs-ingestion.yaml) which creates the following resources:
- 


### IAM roles and permissions

### Project seed code



### Project live cycle

## Deployment
Clone the solution [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-reusable-components) to your local development environment:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-reusable-components.git
cd amazon-sagemaker-reusable-components
```

### Create SageMaker Studio
If you don't have SageMaker Studio created and configured in your account, you must [create a new instance of Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio-onboard.html). If you already have Studio, you can continue from [Deploy SageMaker project portfolio](#deploy-sagemaker-project-portfolio) step.
1. Open [Amazon SageMaker Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
1. Select **Amazon SageMaker Studio**:
![](img/amazon-sagemaker-studio-create.png)
1. In the configuration dialog select **Standard setup**, **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and make sure **SageMaker Projects and JumpStart** enabled for the account and Studio users:
![](img/studio-create-confguration.png)
Select **Create a new role** in **Permission** configuration. Review, amend if needed, and accept the permissions for the Studio IAM role:
![](img/studio-iam-role-permissions.png)
1. In the **Network and storage** configuration select VPC and Network Access for Studio. If you select the **VPC only** option, make sure your VPC has internet access:
![](img/studio-network-storage-configuration.png)
1. Click **Submit**

‚ùó You don't need to wait until Studio becomes available and can move on to the next deployment step.

### Deploy SageMaker project portfolio
This solution includes a [SageMaker custom project template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-projects-templates-custom.html) to demonstrate the usage of re-usable governed components in Studio, more specifically for automation of feature transformation and ingestion into the [SageMaker Feature Store](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/feature-store/). This project template is delivered as [AWS Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/) product and available for usage in Studio **Components and registries** menu under **Projects**.

You must follow the following deployment steps to provision all necessary artifacts before starting Studio:

1. [Package CloudFormation templates](package-cfn.md)
1. Get the ARN of the SageMaker execution role:  
    a. Get the SageMaker DomainId:
    ```sh
    export SM_DOMAIN_ID=$(aws sagemaker list-domains \
        --output text --query 'Domains[0].DomainId')
    ```
    b. Get the SageMaker execution role ARN:
    ```sh
    export SM_EXECUTION_ROLE=$(aws sagemaker describe-domain \
        --domain-id $SM_DOMAIN_ID \
        --output text --query 'DefaultUserSettings.ExecutionRole')
    ```
1. Deploy AWS Service Catalog product portfolio:
```sh
S3_BUCKET_NAME=<S3 bucket name you used to package CloudFormation templates in step 1>
STACK_NAME=sm-project-sc-portfolio

aws cloudformation create-stack \
    --template-url https://s3.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/$S3_BUCKET_NAME/amazon-sagemaker-reusable-components/sm-project-sc-portfolio.yaml \
    --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION \
    --stack-name $STACK_NAME  \
    --disable-rollback \
    --parameters \
        ParameterKey=SCPortfolioPrincipalRoleArn,ParameterValue=$SM_EXECUTION_ROLE
```

Wait until CloudFormation stack successfully deployed into your account and proceed with the next step.

### Add permissions to Service Catalog launch IAM role
AWS Service Catalog uses a default [`AmazonSageMakerServiceCatalogProductsLaunchRole` IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security-iam-awsmanpol-sc.html) to launch CloudFormation templates with SageMaker projects. This role is automatically created during provisioning of SageMaker Studio.

To deploy our Feature Store ingestion product as a SageMaker project, this role needs additional permissions. The all needed permissions are defined in a [managed policy](cfn-templates/sm-sc-policies.yaml), which we must attach to 
 `AmazonSageMakerServiceCatalogProductsLaunchRole` role before we can start SageMaker project deployment.  
First, deploy the managed policy via the provided CloudFormation template:
```sh
aws cloudformation deploy \
    --template-file cfn-templates/sm-sc-policies.yaml \
    --stack-name sagemaker-sc-policies \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

Secondly, attach the created managed policy to the `AmazonSageMakerServiceCatalogProductsLaunchRole` role.  
Retrieve the managed policy ARN:
```sh
export SM_SC_FS_INGESTION_POLICY_ARN=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name "sagemaker-sc-policies" \
    --output text \
    --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`FSIngestionProductPolicyArn`].OutputValue')
```

Attach the policy to the role:
```sh
aws iam attach-role-policy \
    --role-name AmazonSageMakerServiceCatalogProductsLaunchRole \
    --policy-arn $SM_SC_FS_INGESTION_POLICY_ARN
```

### Start Studio
To launch Studio you must go to [SageMaker Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?#/dashboard), click **Open SageMaker Studio** and check that **Status** is `Ready`. 
Make sure that Amazon SageMaker project templates are enabled for your account and Studio users in **Studio Summary** pane:

![](img/studio-summary-projects-enabled.png)

If projects are disabled, click on **Edit Settings**:

![](img/studio-summary-projects-disabled.png)

and enable the projects in the settings window, click Submit:

![](img/studio-settings-enable-projects.png)

If you don't have a studio user, click on the **Add user** in the SageMaker Studio Control panel. Otherwise click on **Open Studio**.

![](img/studio-add-user.png)

To add a new studio user, enter the corresponding SageMaker execution role which was created in the step [Create SageMaker Studio](#create-sagemaker-studio) in the Add user panel and click Submit:

![](img/studio-add-user-panel.png)

After a user profile created, you can click on **Open Studio** link. You will be redirected to a new browser window with Studio IDE.

![](img/studio-profile-open-studio.png)

Wait until Studio finishes creation of a default JupyterServer application:

![](img/studio-creating-jupyter-server.png)

and you presented with Launcher landing page:

![](img/studio-launcher-landing-page.png)

### Clone code repository
To use the provided notebooks you must clone the source code repository into your Studio environment.
Open a system terminal in Studio in the **Launcher** window:

![](img/studio-system-terminal.png)

Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-reusable-components.git
```

The code repository will be downloaded and saved in your home directory in Studio.
Now go to the file browser and open [00-setup](notebooks/00-setup.ipynb) notebook:

![](img/file-browser-setup.png)

The first start of the notebook kernel on a new KernelGateway app takes about 5 minutes. Continue with further instructions in the notebook after Kernel is ready.
